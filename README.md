# Roll-midi-notes-using DRYWETMIDI in a Datagridview-object-Vstudio
I created a simply Roll notes like grid seq or beat 
box. 

You can delete notes using right click


I have used drywetmidi.dll library, its incredible good
No latency, neither hangs.. Simply VERY GOOD ! 


For a long time I wanted to have a kind of piano roll where I could see the notes of a piano with midi output, so while researching how to adapt a grid to see those notes, I discovered that a simple datagridview could be useful. In the end I got it, but all the notes have the same duration, as they are subject to sounding / turning off from column to column. That is why I ask for help from those who see this project. I would like to be able to change the duration of the notes, either with a value in each cell or with a different color for each duration. Thank you !!!


I m looking for a help to modify duration notes !!
